This script is intended for who wants to look at movies from the bed or from the sofa, using a secondary screen connected to his/her laptop.
Thanks to python-homeTheater you can simply run the script and on the first monitor of your laptop a black screen will appear. Moving the mouse to the bottom of the black screen 2 button will be shown, allowing you to close the script or shutting down the computer, without the need of getting off from your sofa/bed.

In case you started the shutdown procedure by mistake (by clicking on the shutdown button), you can easily abort it relaunching the script.

## Usage

    $ python homeTheater.py
